"""Domain-agnostic solver interface.

This module owns the data contracts that cross the Stage-1 → Stage-2 boundary
and the Stage-2 → Stage-3 boundary of the reasoning pipeline.

Design rule: NOTHING in this module may contain domain-specific entity names
(no Port, no Machine, no Flight).  Domain semantics travel in
``EntityState.attributes`` (a JSONB-sourced dict) and ``ResponseOption.label``
strings chosen by the adapter layer — never in field names or class names here.

Slot for future work
---------------------
``Solver.solve`` is the exact seam where OR-Tools / a discrete-event engine
plugs in per domain.  The swap is configuration-only — no other file in
``/src/core``, ``/src/reasoning``, or ``/src/api`` changes when you replace
``StubSolver`` with a real implementation.  See ``src/solver/`` for the stub
and for future domain-specific implementations.
