"""Three-stage reasoning pipeline orchestrator.

Architecture (important boundary):
  We use our OWN thin orchestrator for the three stages rather than handing
  control to Llama Stack's agent loop.  Stages 1 and 2 are deterministic and
  contain NO LLM calls; Llama Stack's agent loop is built around LLM-driven
  tool calling and would fight that design.

  Stage 1 calls AGE directly.
  Stage 2 calls PostGIS directly and then calls the Solver.
  Stage 3 calls LLMClientBase for vector_search() + generate().
  The LLM client is the inference/vector *backend*, not the top-level
  controller.

  The live store is NEVER mutated by this pipeline.
