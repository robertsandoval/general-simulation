"""Llama Stack tool wrapper for the Stage-2 solver.

Registers ``solve()`` as a callable tool so the LLM can request a fresh
quantitative solve mid-reasoning.  Same wrap-don't-duplicate rule as the
ingestion tool: the callable delegates straight to ``StubSolver.solve()``
(or whatever solver is injected) — no logic is repeated here.

Usage in the reasoning pipeline (Phase 7):
    from src.solver.tool import SOLVER_TOOL_SCHEMA, call_solver_tool

    # Offer the tool to the LLM:
    result = await llm_client.generate(messages, tools=[SOLVER_TOOL_SCHEMA])

    # When the LLM emits a tool call, dispatch it:
    if result.tool_calls:
        output = await call_solver_tool(
            result.tool_calls[0].arguments,
            subgraph,
            live_state,
        )
